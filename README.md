# Introduction

As a power IntelliJ IDEA user I am used to the key bindings for years and therefore I created this package to be able to use the same bindings in the Atom editor too. I hope you can also make use of it and contributions/feedbacks are welcome.

# Features

The `intellij-idea-keymap` package has the following features:

* Basic key bindings of IntelliJ IDEA are mapped to core commands in Atom for Mac OSX

# Installation

To install the package please execute the following command in a terminal:

```shell
apm install intellij-idea-keymap
```

If the `apm` command is not recognized then please open Atom, open the `Atom` menu, and select `Install Shell Commands`. Then try it again.

# Changelog

Please have a look at the changelog [here](https://github.com/guylabs/intellij-idea-keymap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

# Known issues

* The initial version (`0.1.0`) does just support the *basic* Mac OSX key bindings of IntelliJ IDEA. Have a look the keymap [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/docs/IntelliJIDEA_ReferenceCard_Mac.pdf)

# Contribution

If you want to add the Windows/Linux based keymaps or add any additions to the Mac OSX one please create a pull request and I will try my best to review and merge it. Contributing is highly appreciated! Thanks in advance.
